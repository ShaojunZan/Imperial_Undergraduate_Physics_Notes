# Imperial_Undergraduate_Physics_Notes
This repository contains my personal notes and summaries from various courses, lectures, and readings in my first three years in physics at **Imperial College London**. They are written primarily in **LaTeX**, and include textbook insights, lecture content, and some of my own thoughts.  
‚ö†Ô∏è *There are likely typos, misunderstandings, or omissions ‚Äî all errors are my own.*

## üóÇÔ∏è Course Overview

### üßÆ Year 1 (2022‚Äì2023)

- **Mechanics: Functions** - part of the course of **PHYS40002: Mechanics and Relativity 2022-2023**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Frank Berkshire  
  Important reminder: As the first course in college, my notes are heavily based on his originally hand-written notes (mostly as my practice of initial familiarization with LaTeX), with the section of conics as my own supplements. The front cover is from the library of overleaf LaTeX templates.
  
- **Vibrations and Waves** - part of the course of **PHYS40003: Oscillations and Waves 2022-2023**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Michael Damzen

- **O&W Summary** and **O&W Condensed Summary** - summary notes of the course of **PHYS40003: Oscillations and Waves 2022-2023**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Carlo Contaldi, Mr. Chris Carr, Prof. Michael Damzen, Dr. Masoud Seifikar, Dr. Isabel Rabey, Prof. Michael Tarbutt  
  In the condensed summary, most graphs and some explanations are omitted.

- **Vector Calculus** - part of the course of **PHYS40004 - Vector Fields, Electricity and Magnetism 2022-2023**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Steve Warren (currently Prof. Martin McCall)  
  Important reminder: My notes are also heavily based on Prof. Warren's hand-written notes. This is my second full-scale trial for LaTeX (and mainly its plotting).

### üå°Ô∏è Year 2 (2023‚Äì2024)

- **Structure of Matter**, **Thermodynamics Notes**, and **Statistical Physics: Outline Notes** - parts of the course of **PHYS50002 -Thermal Physics and Structure of Matter 2023-2024**  
  Lecturer: Dr. Lorenzo Matteini, Prof. Jon Marangos, Prof. Carl Paterson, Dr. Vijay Tymms, Dr. Jon Fenton  
  Important reminder: The cover design of my thermodynamics notes was inspired by a post on Stack Exchange. I have made some modifications, but unfortunately I could not locate the original author. Please let me know if you are the creator, and I‚Äôll be happy to give proper credit.

- **Differential Equations** and **Electromagnetism** - parts of the course of **PHYS50003 - Differential Equations and Electromagnetism 2023-2024**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Alan Heavens, Dr. Robert Kingham, Dr. Jaroslaw Pasternak  
  Important reminder: The front cover of Differential Equations is from the library of overleaf LaTeX templates.

- **Baby Quantum Mechanics** and **Atomic Physics** - parts of the course of **PHYS50004 - Quantum Physics 2023-2024**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Fay Dowker, Prof. Steve Kolthammer

- **Math Methods** - notes of the course of **PHYS50007 - Mathematical Methods 2023-2024**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Dmitry Turaev

### ‚öõÔ∏è Year 3 (2024‚Äì2025)

- **Nuclear & Particle Physics Notes** - from **PHYS60001 - Nuclear and Particle Physics 2024-2025**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Paul Dauncey  
  Important reminder: Most graphs apart from Feynman diagrams are copied from the lecture notes.

- **Solid State Physics Notes** - from **PHYS60003 - Solid State Physics 2024-2025**  
  Lecturer: Prof. Rupert Oulton  
  Important reminder: Most graphs are copied from the lecture notes. Some other graphs are from **The Oxford Solid State Basics** by Professor Steven H.

### üìö Miscellaneous

- **Calculus: Volumes of Revolution**  
  This should belong to part of the **Mechanics: Functions** course, but I am personally so satisfied with the visualizations I made (back in year 1). So I made this specific section a separate file.üòÑ

- **AP Economics**  
  This is the file rewritten in **LaTeX** from my notes in high school. Additionally, I included a part of my studies in a summer school back in grade 11: **Introduction to Fixed Income Securities**, lectured by Prof. Martin Cherkes from Princeton University.  
  Important reminder: The front cover is from the library of overleaf LaTeX templates.
